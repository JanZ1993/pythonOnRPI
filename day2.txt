steps to carry out on Master class day 2 by Rob, Introduction to programming:

---today you work individually at your own pace---

1 follow the tutorial on https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up to setup your RPI
2 open the webbrowser on your RPI and if it works cherish this moment (!)
3 open the text editor Geany that is already installed on the RPI or use another text editor if you prefer
4 follow the tutorial on https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-git
5 make a fork with the pythonExercises repository of Rob on github so that you own the repository yourself in the cloud
6 open a terminal on your RPI
7 use pwd, ls, df, du by typing in these Linux commands in the terminal and pressing enter and look at the outcome
8 make a new directory in the terminal by typing mkdir pythonExercises
9 go to it with cd pythonExercises
10 type in pwd
11 use git to make a local copy in the current directory on your RPI of the repository that you have in the cloud
12 open the first exercise in the text editor 
13 do some programming in the python script and adapt the code to the latest version of python that is available
14 run the python script and look at the outcome
15 commit your solution to the first exercise in the local repository on your RPI and then push it up to your own repository in github in the cloud
16 create a pull request to Rob so that Rob gets your solution
17 wait for feedback in github from Rob
18 repeat until you have made all exercises

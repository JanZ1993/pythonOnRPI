---today you work individually at your own pace---

1 follow the tutorial on https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up to setup your RPI
2 open the webbrowser on your RPI and if it works cherish this moment (!)
3 install Sublime on your RPI, currently the best text editor in the market, it is for free
4 follow the tutorial on https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-git

6 open a terminal on your RPI
7 use pwd, ls, df, du by typing in these Linux commands in the terminal and pressing enter and look at the outcome
8 make a new directory in the terminal by typing mkdir pythonExercises
9 go to it with cd pythonExercises
10 type in pwd
11 use git to make a local copy of your repository that is in the cloud in the current directory on your RPI
12 open the first exercise in the Sublime editor 
13 do some programming in the python script and adapt the code to the latest version of python that is available
14 run the python script and look at the outcome
15 commit your solution to the exercise in the local repository on your RPI and then push it up to your own repository in github
